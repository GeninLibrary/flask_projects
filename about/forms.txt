FORMS: 

The modern internet is user-driven; much of the actual content of a website is generated by the users of a website. How does the user manage to get his or her data to the page?? One word: forms. The HTML forms are the way in which users are able to pass data to the back end of a website where it can be processed and stored. Processing form data correctly is a huge part of what it takes to become a back-end developer.


Format:

			<form action='/users' method='post'>
		   	 	Name:<input type='text' name='name'>
    				Email:<input type='text' name='email'>
    				<input type='submit' value='Submit'>
			</form>



			- Everything within the <form> tag can be transmitted to another page
			- The "action" attribute will be set equal to the route where the information
				in the form will be sent to (here we are sending it to '/users'
			- The "method" attribute will either be GET or POST (GET for insensitive data
				and POST for sensitive data)
			- The "input" element denotes what type of information the client can enter
				(text, radio button, password, checkbox)
				
				* input element must have "name" attribute in order to be recognized
				  by server. When the HTML form gathers up your data it will create a 
				  set of key/value pairs with the name attributes as the keys and the 
				  data (user input) as the values. 


SO, IN SUMMARY: The "form" data will be sent to the server when the user clicks submit. The form data is 
		organized into key/value pairs and submitted to the URL specificed by your form's 'action'
		attribute using the HTTP method specificed in your form's "method" attrbitue. 


		To access the data that the user enters in the input field we use this format
			request.form['name_of_input'] --> name = request.form['name']
