Static Content: any content that can be served to the client without being modified, generated, or processed
		by the server. (Every framework will have its own way of serving static content)

Flask serves static content from a directory that must be called 'static'. This static folder will be used to 
serve all of your stylesheets, images, and Javascript files.

		(we can place a CSS, JS, or image directly into our static folder and then access them in our
		 HTML file -- which we can render with flask)
