Basic Routing:

@app.route('route name/symbol here')


Routes are key pieces of web applications. They are much like variables that you can tie to your application.

The route name/decorator points the server towards a specific set of instructions, which tell the server how
to interpret the data its being sent, the operations it needs to complete, and the response it should send
back. 

So the server follows the route and finds an instruction pamphlet that we (the programmer) wrote.

-------------------------

Every route has two parts: 
				- HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)	
				- URL

-------------------------

HTTP methods: 

				- GET: if no routes are mentioned 'GET' will be the default. 'GET' routes
				       will mostly be used for serving pages or rendering templates.

				- POST

				- PUT

				- PATCH

				- DELETE
