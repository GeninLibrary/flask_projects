HTTP Methods:

The "GET" Method: The GET method is used to request information from a server. When you type in the URL of a 
website you're sending a GET request to retrive that data. 

		We can also use GET requests with forms when we want to pass insensitve information to a 
		server (when you Google an word or phrase, for example). A form allows a client to send a
		GET request to server, asking for specific information. 


The "POST" Method: POST passes data behind the scenes in the HTTP request message body. These request are 
never cached, not saved in history, can't be bookmarked, and aren't limited by data restrictions (
meaning you can send BIG files easily). Most forms use POST requests to send data. In 
		
		In general, most forms should always be sent using POST (not GET). The only case otherwise
		is if the user needs to preserve the query string (as in seeing what you've already searched
		for in Google). 


PUT, PATCH, DELETE: These exist for the express purpose of designing API's. These are support methods in 
your HTML code, and only work when being handles by Javascript Ajax requests.
