Flask is a web framework that allows programmers to quickly create applications. It conveys a system of 
commands to a backend server, using decorators (url variables like '/' and '@' and var names) to point the 
backend to functions and files that the programmer wants tied to the webpage/application. 

Think of Flask as a framework that allows programmers to put variables into a URL, which a server can then 
interpret and act on. 


Format:
	
		from flask import Flask
		app = Flask(__name__)
	
		@app.route('/')
	
		def Function()...

		app.run(debug = True)
